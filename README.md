# Invoice API - Backend Web Development Project

This repository contains a backend web development project.

## üìã Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to show the development of a **Spring Boot API** for managing client invoices based on selected products. The API supports shopping cart operations, validation of product availability, and generation of complete invoices with tax calculations (I've done another API to manage exchange-rate, but maybe I'll upload it in another repository).

This API is integrated into a **microservices architecture** that includes:
- `customer-service`
- `product-service`
- `invoice-service` (this project)
- `config-service` (centralized config)
- `eureka-server` (service registry)
- `admin-service` (monitoring)
- `gateway-service` (API gateway)

## ‚úÖ Main Features

- **Add to Cart**: Validates customer RFC and checks if the product exists via GTIN. It verifies stock availability before adding or updating items in the cart.
- **Update Quantity**: If a product already exists in the cart, it updates the quantity rather than duplicating the entry.
- **Generate Invoice**:
  - Calculates total, subtotal, and taxes (16% IVA).
  - Updates product stock.
  - Stores all invoice and item data in the database.
  - Empties the customer's cart once the invoice is generated.

And so on!
